Vulnerabilities are documented using the Common\n                  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system to provide a permanent\n                  searchable record allowing administrators to accurately judge the\n                  risks of running a particular version of Apptainer within their\n                  environment.\n              </li>\n          </ul>\n          <ul>\n              <li>\n                  <strong><b>Enable stakeholders over malicious actors: </b></strong>\n                  When a new vulnerability is publicly announced, a race begins between\n                  system administrators and those with nefarious intent. Apptainer\n                  collaborators that distribute Apptainer only in binary form are provided security patches prior to security\n                  announcements.  They then distribute patched binaries to their stakeholders as a head start in the security race. Although\n                  patched binaries are made available to Apptainer stakeholders first, they\n                  are provided without releasing security-related information.\n                  This limits exposure to the open source community while still\n                  providing a way of remediation for Apptainer stakeholders, with a\n                  level of proactive measure.\n              </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3><b>Apptainer vulnerability procedure</b></h3>\n          <p>\n              When a vulnerability is discovered, the TSC takes the following\n              steps:\n          </p>\n          <ol>\n              <li>\n                  Perform due diligence to fully replicate and describe the scope and\n                  severity of the bug.
