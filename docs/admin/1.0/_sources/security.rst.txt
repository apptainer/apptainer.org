 Security in {Project}
###########################

*****************
 Security Policy
*****************

If you suspect you have found a vulnerability in {Project} we want
to work with you so that it can be investigated, fixed, and disclosed in
a responsible manner. Please follow the steps in our published `Security
Policy <https://apptainer.org/security-policy/>`__, which begins with
contacting us privately via security@apptainer.org

The {Project} community discloses vulnerabilities found in {Project} through public
CVE reports, and notifications on our community channels. We encourage
all users to monitor new releases of {Project} for security
information. Security patches are applied to the latest open-source
release.

************
 Background
************

{Project} grew out of the need to implement a container platform
that was suitable for use on shared systems, such as HPC clusters. In
these environments multiple people access a shared resource. User
accounts, groups, and standard file permissions limit their access to
data, devices, and prevent them from disrupting or accessing others'
work.

To provide security in these environments a container needs to run as
the user who starts it on the system. Before the widespread adoption of
the Linux user namespace, only a privileged user could perform the
operations which are needed to run a container. A default Docker
installation uses a root-owned daemon to start containers. Users can
request that the daemon starts a container on their behalf. However,
coordinating a daemon with other schedulers is difficult and, since the
daemon is privileged, users can ask it to carry out actions that they
wouldn't normally have permission to do.

When a user runs a container with {Project}, it is started as a
normal process running under the user's account. Standard file
permissions and other security controls based on user accounts, groups,
and processes apply. In a default installation {Project} uses a
setuid starter binary to perform only the specific tasks needed to setup
the container.

**************************
 Setuid & User Namespaces
**************************

Using a setuid binary to run container setup operations is essential to
support containers on older Linux distributions, such as CentOS 6, that
were previously common in HPC and enterprise. Newer distributions have
support for 'unprivileged user namespace creation'. This means a normal
user can create a user namespace, in which most setup operations needed
to run a container can be run, unprivileged.

{Project} supports running containers without setuid, using user
namespaces. It can be compiled with the ``--without-suid`` option, or
``allow setuid = no`` can be set in ``{command}.conf`` to enable this.
In this mode *all* operations run as the user who starts the
``{command}`` program. However, there are some disadvantages:

-  SIF and other single file container images cannot be mounted
   directly. The container image must be extracted to a directory on
   disk to run. This may impact the speed of execution. Workloads accessing
   large numbers of small files (such as python application startup) do
   not benefit from the reduced metadata load on the filesystem an image
   file provides. (This behavior could be done by an unprivileged FUSE
   mount but that is not yet implemented).

-  Persistent overlays using the exec/run/shell ``--overlay`` option does not
   work because that uses the privileged kernel OverlayFS filesystem.
   (This behavior could be done with unprivileged OverlayFS in recent
   kernels but that is not yet implemented).

-  The effectiveness of signing and verifying container images is
   reduced as, when extracted to a directory, modification is possible
   and verification of the image's original signature cannot be
   performed.

-  Encryption is not supported. {Project} leverages kernel LUKS2
   mounts to run encrypted containers without decrypting their content
   to disk.

Because of the points above, the default mode of operation of
{Project} uses a setuid binary. The {Project} community aims to reduce the
circumstances that require this as new functionality is developed and
reaches commonly deployed Linux distributions.

********************************
 Runtime & User Privilege Model
********************************

While other runtimes have aimed to safely sandbox containers executing
as the ``root`` user, so that they cannot affect the host system,
{Project} has adopted an alternative security model:

-  Containers should be run as an unprivileged user.

-  The user should never be able to elevate their privileges inside the
   container to gain control over the host.

-  All permission restrictions on the user outside of a container should
   apply inside the container.

-  Favor integration over isolation. Allow a user to use host resources
   such as GPUs, network file systems, high speed interconnects easily.
   The process ID space, network etc. are not isolated in separate
   namespaces by default.

To accomplish this, {Project} uses a number of Linux kernel
features. The container file system is mounted using the ``nosuid``
option, and processes are started with the ``PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`` flag.
This means that there is no possible way to change the user or group id,
gain root privileges or gain any additional capabilities when executing
another program.

If you do require the additional isolation of the network, devices, PIDs
etc. provided by other runtimes, {Project} can make use of
additional namespaces and functionality such as seccomp and cgroups.

********************************
 Singularity Image Format (SIF)
********************************

{Project} uses SIF as its default container format. A SIF container
is a single file, which makes it easy to manage and distribute. Inside
the SIF file, the container filesystem is held in a SquashFS object. By
default, we mount the container filesystem directly using SquashFS. On a
network filesystem this means that reads from the container are
data-only. Metadata operations happen locally, speeding up workloads
with many small files.

Holding the container image in a single file also enables unique security
features. The container filesystem is immutable, and can be signed. The
signature travels in the SIF image itself so that it is always possible
to verify that the image has not been tampered with or corrupted.

We use private PGP keys to create a container signature, and the corresponding
public key in order to verify the container signature. Verification of signed
containers can be done at any time by a user and happens automatically in
``{command} pull`` commands against the Library API registries. The prevalence
of PGP key servers, (like https://keys.openpgp.org/), make sharing and obtaining
public keys for container verification relatively simple.

A container may be signed once, by a trusted individual who approves its
use. It could also be signed with multiple keys to signify it has passed
each step in a CI/CD QA & Security process. {Project} can be
configured with an execution control list (ECL), which requires the
presence of one or more valid signatures, to limit execution to approved
containers.

The root filesystem of a container
(stored in the squashFS partition of SIF) can be encrypted. As a result,
everything inside the container becomes inaccessible without the correct
key or passphrase. The content of the container is private, even if the
SIF file is shared in public.

Encryption and decryption are performed using the Linux kernel's LUKS2
feature. This is the same technology routinely used for full disk
encryption. The encrypted container is mounted directly through the
kernel. Unlike other container formats, an encrypted container is not
decrypted to disk in order to run it.

*********************************
 Configuration & Runtime Options
*********************************

System administrators who manage {Project} can use configuration
files to set security restrictions, grant or revoke a user's
capabilities, manage resources and authorize containers etc.

For example, the :ref:`Execution Control List <execution_control_list>` file
allows restricting usage of SIF containers based on their signature
and the key used to sign them.

Configuration files and their parameters are :ref:`documented for
administrators here <{command}_configfiles>`.

When running a container as root, {Project} can apply hardening rules using
cgroups, seccomp, apparmor. See the 'security options' section of the user
guide, and :ref:`cgroups.toml documentation <cgroups_toml>`.
