###################################
 {Project} Configuration Files
###################################

As {aProject} Administrator, you will have access to various
configuration files, that will let you manage container resources, set
security restrictions and configure network options etc, when
installing {Project} across the system. All of these files can be
found in ``/usr/local/etc/{command}`` by default for installations
from source (though the location may differ based on options passed
during the installation). For installations from RPM or Deb packages
you will find the configuration files in ``/etc/{command}``. This
section will describe the configuration files and the various
parameters contained by them.

******************
 {command}.conf
******************

Most of the configuration options are set using the file
``{command}.conf`` that defines the global configuration for
{Project} across the entire system. Using this file, system
administrators can influence the behavior of {Project} and
restrict the functionality that users can access. As a security
measure, for ``setuid`` installations of {Project},
``{command}.conf`` must be owned by root and must not be writable by
users or {Project} will refuse to run. This is not the case for
``non-setuid`` installations that will only ever execute with user
privilege and thus do not require such limitations.

The options set via ``{command}.conf`` are listed below. Options are
grouped together based on relevance. The actual order of options within
``{command}.conf`` may differ.

Setuid and Capabilities
=======================

``allow setuid``: To use all features of {Project} containers,
{Project} will need to have access to some privileged system calls.
{Project} achieves this by using a helper binary with the ``setuid``
bit enabled. The ``allow-setuid`` option lets you enable/disable users
ability to utilize these binaries within {Project}. By default, it
is set to "yes", but that only makes a difference if the suid helper
binary is installed, which is not the case by default (see the
:ref:`Installation section <installation>`).

``root default capabilities``: {Project} allows the specification of
capabilities kept by the root user when running a container in
setuid (also known as SUID) mode.
Options include:

-  full: all capabilities are maintained, this gives the same behavior
   as the ``--keep-privs`` option.
-  file: only capabilities granted in
   ``/usr/local/etc/{command}/capabilities/user.root`` are maintained.
-  no: no capabilities are maintained, this gives the same behavior as
   the ``--no-privs`` option.

.. note::

   The root user can manage the capabilities granted to individual
   containers when they are launched through the ``--add-caps`` and
   ``drop-caps`` flags. Please see `Linux Capabilities
   <{userdocs}/security_options.html#linux-capabilities>`_
   in the user guide for more information.

Loop Devices
============

{Project} in SUID mode uses loop devices to facilitate the mounting of
container file systems from SIF and other images.

``max loop devices``: This option allows an admin to limit the total
number of loop devices {Project} will consume at a given time.

``shared loop devices``: This allows containers running the same image
to share a single loop device. This minimizes loop device usage and
helps optimize kernel cache usage. Enabling this feature can be
particularly useful for MPI jobs.

Namespace Options
=================

``allow pid ns``: This option determines if users can leverage the PID
namespace when running their containers through the ``--pid`` flag.

.. note::

   Using the PID namespace can confuse the process tracking of some
   resource managers, as well as some MPI implementations.

Configuration Files
===================

{Project} can automatically create or modify several system files
within containers to ease usage.

.. note::

   These options will have no effect if the file does not exist within
   the container, or overlay or underlay support are enabled.

``config passwd``: This option determines if {Project} should
automatically append an entry to ``/etc/passwd`` for the user running
the container.

``config group``: This option determines if {Project} should
automatically append the calling user's group entries to the containers
``/etc/group``.

``config resolv_conf``: This option determines if {Project} should
automatically bind the host's ``/etc/resolv.conf`` within the container.

Session Directory and System Mounts
===================================

``sessiondir max size``: In order for the {Project} runtime to run
a container it needs to create a temporary in-memory ``sessiondir`` as
a location to assemble various components of the container, including
mounting filesystems over the base image. In addition, this sessiondir
will hold files that are written to the container when
``--writable-tmpfs`` is used, plus isolated temporary filesystems in
``--contain`` mode. The default value is
64MiB. If users commonly run containers with ``--writable-tmpfs`` or
``--contain``, this value should be increased to
accommodate their workflows. The tmpfs will grow to the specified
maximum size, as required. Memory is not allocated ahead of usage.

``mount proc``: This option determines if {Project} should
automatically bind mount ``/proc`` within the container.

``mount sys``: This option determines if {Project} should
automatically bind mount ``/sys`` within the container.

``mount dev``: Should be set to "YES", if you want {Project} to
automatically bind mount a complete ``/dev`` tree within the container.
If set to ``minimal``, then only ``/dev/null``, ``/dev/zero``,
``/dev/random``, ``/dev/urandom``, and ``/dev/shm`` will be included.

``mount devpts``: This option determines if {Project} will mount a
new instance of ``devpts`` when there is a ``minimal`` ``/dev``
directory as explained above, or when the ``--contain`` option is
passed.

.. note::

   This requires either a kernel configured with
   ``CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES=y``, or a kernel version at or
   newer than ``4.7``.

``mount home``: When this option is enabled, {Project} will
automatically determine the calling user's home directory and attempt to
mount it into the container.

``mount tmp``: When this option is enabled, {Project} will
automatically bind mount ``/tmp`` and ``/var/tmp`` into the container
from the host. If the ``--contain`` option is passed, {Project} will
create both locations within the ``sessiondir`` or within the directory
specified by the ``--workdir`` option if that is passed as well.

``mount hostfs``: This option will cause {Project} to probe the host
for all mounted filesystems and bind those into containers at runtime.

``mount slave``: {Project} automatically mounts a handful host
system directories to the container by default. This option determines
if filesystem changes on the host should automatically be propagated to
those directories in the container.

.. note::

   This should be set to ``yes`` when autofs mounts occurring on the host
   system should be reflected up in the container.

``memory fs type``: This option allows admins to choose the temporary
filesystem used by {Project}. Temporary filesystems are primarily
used for system directories like ``/dev`` when the host system directory
is not mounted within the container.

.. note::

   For Cray CLE 5 and 6, up to CLE 6.0.UP05, there is an issue (kernel
   panic) when {Project} uses tmpfs, so on affected systems it's
   recommended to set this value to ``ramfs`` to avoid a kernel panic.

Bind Mount Management
=====================

``bind path``: This option is used to define a list of files or
directories to automatically be made available when {Project} runs a
container. In order to successfully mount listed paths the file or
directory must exist within the container, or {Project} must be
configured with either overlay or underlay support enabled.

.. note::

   This option is ignored when containers are invoked with the
   ``--contain`` option.

You can define the a bind point where the source and destination are
identical:

.. code::

   bind path = /etc/localtime

Or you can specify different source and destination locations using a
colon:

.. code::

   bind path = /etc/{command}/default-nsswitch.conf:/etc/nsswitch.conf

``user bind control``: This allows admins to decide if users can define
bind points at runtime. By Default, this option is set to ``YES``, which
means users can specify bind points, scratch and tmp locations.

Limiting Container Execution
============================

There are several ways to limit container execution as an admin listed
below. If stricter controls are required, check out the :ref:`Execution
Control List <execution_control_list>`.

``limit container owners``: This restricts container execution to only
allow containers that are owned by the specified user.

.. note::

   This feature will only apply when {Project} is running in SUID
   mode and the user is non-root. By default this is set to ``NULL``.

``limit container groups``: This restricts container execution to only
allow containers that are owned by the specified group.

.. note::

   This feature will only apply when {Project} is running in SUID
   mode and the user is non-root. By default this is set to ``NULL``.

``limit container paths``: This restricts container execution to only
allow containers that are located within the specified path prefix.

.. note::

   This feature will only apply when {Project} is running in SUID
   mode and the user is non-root. By default this is set to ``NULL``.

``allow container ${type}``: This set of options allows admins to limit the
types of image formats that can be leveraged by users with
{Project} of the following types:

-  ``allow container sif`` permits / denies execution of unencrypted SIF
   containers.
-  ``allow container encrypted`` permits / denies execution of SIF
   containers with an encrypted root filesystem.
-  ``allow container squashfs`` permits / denies execution of bare
   SquashFS image files. E.g. Singularity 2.x images.
-  ``allow container extfs`` permits / denies execution of bare EXT
   image files.
-  ``allow container dir`` permits / denies execution of sandbox
   directory containers.

.. note::

   These limitations do not apply to the root user.

Networking Options
==================

The ``--network`` option can be used to specify a CNI networking
configuration that will be used when running a container with `network
virtualization
<{userdocs}/networking.html>`_.
Unrestricted use of CNI network configurations requires root privilege,
as certain configurations may disrupt the host networking environment.

{Project} allows specific users or groups to be granted the
ability to run containers with administrator specified CNI
configurations.
These features only have an effect when {Project} is running in SUID
mode and the user is non-root.

``allow net users``: Allow specified root administered CNI network
configurations to be used by the specified list of users. By default
only root may use CNI configuration, except in the case of a fakeroot
execution where only 40_fakeroot.conflist is used. 

``allow net groups``: Allow specified root administered CNI network
configurations to be used by the specified list of users. By default
only root may use CNI configuration, except in the case of a fakeroot
execution where only 40_fakeroot.conflist is used.

``allow net networks``: Specify the names of CNI network configurations
that may be used by users and groups listed in the allow net users /
allow net groups directives.

GPU Options
===========

{Project} provides integration with GPUs in order to facilitate GPU
based workloads seamlessly. Both options listed below are particularly
useful in GPU only environments. For more information on using GPUs with
{Project} checkout :ref:`GPU Library Configuration
<gpu_library_configuration>`.

``always use nv``: Enabling this option will cause every action command
(``exec/shell/run/instance``) to be executed with the ``--nv`` option
implicitly added.

``always use rocm``: Enabling this option will cause every action
command (``exec/shell/run/instance``) to be executed with the ``--rocm``
option implicitly added.

Supplemental Filesystems
========================

``enable fusemount``: This will allow users to mount fuse filesystems
inside containers using the ``--fusemount`` flag.

``enable overlay``: This option will allow {Project} to create bind
mounts at paths that do not exist within the container image. This
option can be set to ``try`` (the default), which will try to use an overlayfs.
If it fails to create an overlayfs in this case the bind path will be
silently ignored.
If the option is set to ``yes`` then if overlayfs fails in SUID mode it
will be a fatal error,
but if overlayfs fails in non-SUID mode it will use fuse-overlayfs.
Underlay is more efficient than fuse-overlayfs so setting this option
to ``yes`` is generally not desirable.

``enable underlay``: This option will allow {Project} to create bind
mounts at paths that do not exist within the container image, just like
``enable overlay``, but instead using an underlay. This is suitable for
systems where overlay is not possible or not working. If the overlay
option is available and working, it will be used instead.

CNI Configuration and Plugins
=============================

``cni configuration path``: This option allows admins to specify a
custom path for the CNI configuration that {Project} will use for
`Network Virtualization
<{userdocs}/networking.html>`_.

``cni plugin path``: This option allows admins to specify a custom path
for {Project} to access CNI plugin executables. Check out the
`Network Virtualization
<{userdocs}/networking.html>`_
section of the user guide for more information.

External Binaries
=================

{Project} calls a number of external binaries for full functionality. 
They are found using the path defined by the ``binary path`` option in
``{command}.conf``. 
If that option includes ``$PATH:`` (as it does by default) then
that is replaced by the user's ``$PATH`` whenever it isn't some
very basic system command or a command that can be run as root
by the SUID flow.

Concurrent Downloads
====================

{Project} will pull ``library://`` container images
using multiple concurrent downloads of parts of the image. This speeds
up downloads vs using a single stream. The defaults are generally
appropriate for `Library API Registries
<https://singularityhub.github.io/library-api/#/?id=library-api>`_,
but may be tuned for your network conditions, or if you are pulling
from a different library server.

``download concurrency``: specifies how many concurrent streams when
downloading (pulling) an image from cloud library.

``download part size``: specifies the size of each part (bytes) when
concurrent downloads are enabled.

``download buffer size``: specifies the transfer buffer size (bytes)
when concurrent downloads are enabled.

Cgroups Options
===============

``systemd cgroups``: specifies whether to use systemd to manage container
cgroups. Required (with cgroups v2) for unprivileged users to apply resource
limits on containers. If set to ``no``, {Project} will directly manage
cgroups via the cgroupfs.

Updating Configuration Options
==============================

In order to manage this configuration file, {Project} has a ``config
global`` command group that allows you to get, set, reset, and unset
values through the CLI. It's important to note that these commands must
be run with elevated privileges because the ``{command}.conf`` can
only be modified by an administrator.

Example
-------

In this example we will changing the ``bind path`` option described
above. First we can see the current list of bind paths set within our
system configuration:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} config global --get "bind path"
   /etc/localtime,/etc/hosts

Now we can add a new path and verify it was successfully added:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} config global --set "bind path" /etc/resolv.conf
   $ sudo {command} config global --get "bind path"
   /etc/resolv.conf,/etc/localtime,/etc/hosts

From here we can remove a path with:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} config global --unset "bind path" /etc/localtime
   $ sudo {command} config global --get "bind path"
   /etc/resolv.conf,/etc/hosts

If we want to reset the option to the default at installation, then we
can reset it with:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} config global --reset "bind path"
   $ sudo {command} config global --get "bind path"
   /etc/localtime,/etc/hosts

And now we are back to our original option settings. You can also test
what a change would look like by using the ``--dry-run`` option in
conjunction with the above commands. Instead of writing to the
configuration file, it will output what would have been written to the
configuration file if the command had been run without the ``--dry-run``
option:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} config global --dry-run --set "bind path" /etc/resolv.conf
   # {ENVPREFIX}.CONF
   # This is the global configuration file for {Project}. This file controls
   [...]
   # BIND PATH: [STRING]
   # DEFAULT: Undefined
   # Define a list of files/directories that should be made available from within
   # the container. The file or directory must exist within the container on
   # which to attach to. you can specify a different source and destination
   # path (respectively) with a colon; otherwise source and dest are the same.
   # NOTE: these are ignored if {command} is invoked with --contain.
   bind path = /etc/resolv.conf
   bind path = /etc/localtime
   bind path = /etc/hosts
   [...]
   $ sudo {command} config global --get "bind path"
   /etc/localtime,/etc/hosts

Above we can see that ``/etc/resolv.conf`` is listed as a bind path in
the output of the ``--dry-run`` command, but did not affect the actual
bind paths of the system.


.. _cgroups_toml:

**************
 cgroups.toml
**************

The cgroups (control groups) functionality of the Linux kernel allows
you to limit and meter the resources used by a process, or group of
processes. Using cgroups you can limit memory and CPU usage. You can
also rate limit block IO, network IO, and control access to device
nodes.

There are two versions of cgroups in common use. Cgroups v1 sets
resource limits for a process within separate hierarchies per resource
class. Cgroups v2, the default in newer Linux distributions, implements
a unified hierarchy, simplifying the structure of resource limits on
processes.

-  v1 documentation:
   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cgroups.txt
-  v2 documentation:
   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt

{Project} can apply resource limitations to systems
configured for both cgroups v1 and the v2 unified hierarchy. Resource
limits are specified using a TOML file that represents the ``resources``
section of the OCI runtime-spec:
https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config-linux.md#control-groups

On a cgroups v1 system the resources configuration is applied directly.
On a cgroups v2 system the configuration is translated and applied to
the unified hierarchy.

Under cgroups v1, access restrictions for device nodes are managed
directly. Under cgroups v2, the restrictions are applied by attaching
eBPF programs that implement the requested access controls.

Examples
========

To apply resource limits to a container, use the ``--apply-cgroups``
flag, which takes a path to a TOML file specifying the cgroups
configuration to be applied:

.. code::

   $ {command} shell --apply-cgroups /path/to/cgroups.toml my_container.sif

.. note::

   The ``--apply-cgroups`` option requires cgroups v2 to be used without root
   privileges.

Limiting memory
---------------

To limit the amount of memory that your container uses to 500MB
(524288000 bytes), set a ``limit`` value inside the ``[memory]`` section
of your cgroups TOML file:

.. code::

   [memory]
       limit = 524288000

Start your container, applying the toml file, e.g.:

.. code::

   $ {command} run --apply-cgroups path/to/cgroups.toml library://alpine

Limiting CPU
------------

CPU usage can be limited using different strategies, with limits
specified in the ``[cpu]`` section of the TOML file.

**shares**

This corresponds to a ratio versus other cgroups with cpu shares.
Usually the default value is ``1024``. That means if you want to allow
to use 50% of a single CPU, you will set ``512`` as value.

.. code::

   [cpu]
       shares = 512

A cgroup can get more than its share of CPU if there are enough idle CPU
cycles available in the system, due to the work conserving nature of the
scheduler, so a contained process can consume all CPU cycles even with a
ratio of 50%. The ratio is only applied when two or more processes
conflicts with their needs of CPU cycles.

**quota/period**

You can enforce hard limits on the CPU cycles a cgroup can consume, so
contained processes can't use more than the amount of CPU time set for
the cgroup. ``quota`` allows you to configure the amount of CPU time
that a cgroup can use per period. The default is 100ms (100000us). So if
you want to limit amount of CPU time to 20ms during period of 100ms:

.. code::

   [cpu]
       period = 100000
       quota = 20000

**cpus/mems**

You can also restrict access to specific CPUs (cores) and associated
memory nodes by using ``cpus/mems`` fields:

.. code::

   [cpu]
       cpus = "0-1"
       mems = "0-1"

Where container has limited access to CPU 0 and CPU 1.

.. note::

   It's important to set identical values for both ``cpus`` and
   ``mems``.

Limiting IO
-----------

To control block device I/O, applying limits to competing container, use
the ``[blockIO]`` section of the TOML file:

.. code::

   [blockIO]
       weight = 1000
       leafWeight = 1000

``weight`` and ``leafWeight`` accept values between ``10`` and ``1000``.

``weight`` is the default weight of the group on all the devices until
and unless overridden by a per device rule.

``leafWeight`` relates to weight for the purpose of deciding how heavily
to weigh tasks in the given cgroup while competing with the cgroup's
child cgroups.

To apply limits to specific block devices, you must set configuration
for specific device major/minor numbers. For example, to override
``weight/leafWeight`` for ``/dev/loop0`` and ``/dev/loop1`` block
devices, set limits for device major 7, minor 0 and 1:

.. code::

   [blockIO]
       [[blockIO.weightDevice]]
           major = 7
           minor = 0
           weight = 100
           leafWeight = 50
       [[blockIO.weightDevice]]
           major = 7
           minor = 1
           weight = 100
           leafWeight = 50

You can also limit the IO read/write rate to a specific absolute value,
e.g. 16MB per second for the ``/dev/loop0`` block device. The ``rate``
is specified in bytes per second.

.. code::

   [blockIO]
       [[blockIO.throttleReadBpsDevice]]
           major = 7
           minor = 0
           rate = 16777216
       [[blockIO.throttleWriteBpsDevice]]
           major = 7
           minor = 0
           rate = 16777216

Other limits
------------

{Project} can apply all resource limits that are valid in the OCI
runtime-spec ``resources`` section, including ``unified`` cgroups v2
constraints. It is most compatible, however, to use the cgroups v1 limits,
which will be translated to v2 format when applied on a cgroups v2 system.

See
https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config-linux.md#control-groups
for information about the available limits. Note that {Project} uses
TOML format for the configuration file, rather than JSON.

.. _execution_control_list:

**********
 ecl.toml
**********

The execution control list that can be used to restrict the execution of
SIF files by signing key is defined here. You can authorize the
containers by validating both the location of the SIF file in the
filesystem and by checking against a list of signing entities.

.. warning::

   The ECL configuration applies to SIF container images only. To lock
   down execution fully you should disable execution of other container
   types (squashfs/extfs/dir) via the ``{command}.conf`` file ``allow
   container`` settings.

   In an unprivileged installation of {Project}, a user can specify their
   own ``{command}.conf`` via ``--config``, and bypass ECL restrictions.

.. code::

   [[execgroup]]
     tagname = "group2"
     mode = "whitelist"
     dirpath = "/tmp/containers"
     keyfp = ["7064B1D6EFF01B1262FED3F03581D99FE87EAFD1"]

Only the containers running from and signed with above-mentioned path
and keys will be authorized to run.

Three possible list modes you can choose from:

**Whitestrict**: The SIF must be signed by all of the keys mentioned.

**Whitelist**: As long as the SIF is signed by one or more of the keys,
the container is allowed to run.

**Blacklist**: Only the containers whose keys are not mentioned in the
group are allowed to run.

.. note::

   Containers signed by Singularity versions older than 3.6.0 will not
   pass ECL checks because they are insecure.

   To temporarily permit the use of legacy insecure signatures, set
   ``legacyinsecure = true`` in ``ecl.toml``.

Managing ECL public keys
========================

{Project} uses a global keyring for ECL signature
verification. This keyring can be administered using the ``--global``
flag for the following commands:

-  ``{command} key import`` (root user only)
-  ``{command} key pull`` (root user only)
-  ``{command} key remove`` (root user only)
-  ``{command} key export``
-  ``{command} key list``

.. note::

   For security reasons, it is not possible to import private keys into
   this global keyring because it must be accessible by users and is
   stored in the file ``SYSCONFDIR/{command}/global-pgp-public``.

.. _gpu_library_configuration:

***************************
 GPU Library Configuration
***************************

When a container includes a GPU enabled application, {Project} (with
the ``--nv`` or ``--rocm`` options) can properly inject the required
Nvidia or AMD GPU driver libraries into the container, to match the
host's kernel. The GPU ``/dev`` entries are provided in containers run
with ``--nv`` or ``--rocm`` even if the ``--contain`` option is used to
restrict the in-container device tree.

Compatibility between containerized CUDA/ROCm/OpenCL applications and
host drivers/libraries is dependent on the versions of the GPU compute
frameworks that were used to build the applications. Compatibility and
usage information is discussed in the `GPU Support <{userdocs}/gpu.html>`_
section of the user guide.

NVIDIA GPUs / CUDA
==================

The ``nvliblist.conf`` configuration file is used to specify libraries
and executables that need to be injected into the container when running
{Project} with the ``--nv`` Nvidia GPU support option. The provided
``nvliblist.conf`` is suitable for CUDA 11, but may need to be modified
if you need to include additional libraries, or further libraries are
added to newer versions of the Nvidia driver/CUDA distribution.

When adding new entries to ``nvliblist.conf`` use the bare filename of
executables, and the ``xxxx.so`` form of libraries. Libraries are
resolved via ``ldconfig -p``, and exectuables are found by searching
``$PATH``.

Experimental nvidia-container-cli Support
-----------------------------------------

The `nvidia-container-cli
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/libnvidia-container>`_ tool is Nvidia's
officially support method for configuring containers to use a GPU. It is
targeted at OCI container runtimes.

{Project} has an experimental ``--nvccli`` option, which
will call out to ``nvidia-container-cli`` for container GPU setup,
rather than use the ``nvliblist.conf`` approach.

For security reasons, ``nvidia-container-cli`` cannot be used with privileged
mode in a SUID installation of {Project}, it can only be used unprivileged.
The operations performed by ``nvidia-container-cli`` are broadly similar to
those which {Project} carries out when setting up a GPU container
from ``nvliblist.conf``.

AMD Radeon GPUs / ROCm
======================

The ``rocmliblist.conf`` file is used to specify libraries and
executables that need to be injected into the container when running
{Project} with the ``--rocm`` Radeon GPU support option. The
provided ``rocmliblist.conf`` is suitable for ROCm 4.0, but may need to
modified if you need to include additional libraries, or further
libraries are added to newer versions of the ROCm distribution.

When adding new entries to ``rocmlist.conf`` use the bare filename of
executables, and the ``xxxx.so`` form of libraries. Libraries are
resolved via ``ldconfig -p``, and exectuables are found by searching
``$PATH``.

GPU liblist format
==================

The ``nvliblist.conf`` and ``rocmliblist`` files list the basename of
executables and libraries to be bound into the container, without path
information.

Binaries are found by searching ``$PATH``:

.. code::

   # put binaries here
   # In shared environments you should ensure that permissions on these files
   # exclude writing by non-privileged users.
   rocm-smi
   rocminfo

Libraries should be specified without version information, i.e.
``libname.so``, and are resolved using ``ldconfig``.

.. code::

   # put libs here (must end in .so)
   libamd_comgr.so
   libcomgr.so

If you receive warnings that binaries or libraries are not found, ensure
that they are in a system path (binaries), or available in paths
configured in ``/etc/ld.so.conf`` (libraries).

*****************
 capability.json
*****************

.. warning::

   It is extremely important to recognize that **granting users Linux
   capabilities with the** ``capability`` **command group is usually
   identical to granting those users root level access on the host
   system**. Most if not all capabilities will allow users to "break
   out" of the container and become root on the host. This feature is
   targeted toward special use cases (like cloud-native architectures)
   where an admin/developer might want to limit the attack surface
   within a container that normally runs as root. This is not a good
   option in multi-tenant HPC environments where an admin wants to grant
   a user special privileges within a container. For that and similar
   use cases, the :ref:`fakeroot feature <fakeroot>` is a better option.

{Project} in SUID mode provides full support for admins to grant and revoke
Linux capabilities on a user or group basis. The ``capability.json`` file is
maintained by {Project} in order to manage these capabilities. The
``capability`` command group allows you to ``add``, ``drop``, and
``list`` capabilities for users and groups.

For example, let us suppose that we have decided to grant a user (named
``pinger``) capabilities to open raw sockets so that they can use
``ping`` in a container where the binary is controlled via capabilities.

To do so, we would issue a command such as this:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} capability add --user pinger CAP_NET_RAW

This means the user ``pinger`` has just been granted permissions
(through Linux capabilities) to open raw sockets within {Project}
containers.

We can check that this change is in effect with the ``capability list``
command.

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} capability list --user pinger
   CAP_NET_RAW

To take advantage of this new capability, the user ``pinger`` must also
request the capability when executing a container with the
``--add-caps`` flag. ``pinger`` would need to run a command like this:

.. code::

   $ {command} exec --add-caps CAP_NET_RAW \
     library://sylabs/tests/ubuntu_ping:v1.0 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
   PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=73.1 ms

   --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
   1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 73.178/73.178/73.178/0.000 ms

If we decide that it is no longer necessary to allow the user ``pinger``
to open raw sockets within {Project} containers, we can revoke the
appropriate Linux capability like so:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} capability drop --user pinger CAP_NET_RAW

Now if ``pinger`` tries to use ``CAP_NET_RAW``, {Project} will not
give the capability to the container and ``ping`` will fail to create a
socket:

.. code::

   $ {command} exec --add-caps CAP_NET_RAW \
     library://sylabs/tests/ubuntu_ping:v1.0 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
   WARNING: not authorized to add capability: CAP_NET_RAW
   ping: socket: Operation not permitted

The ``capability add`` and ``drop`` subcommands will also accept the
case insensitive keyword ``all`` to grant or revoke all Linux
capabilities to a user or group.

For more information about individual Linux capabilities check out the
`man pages <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>`_
or use the ``capability avail`` command to output available capabilities
with a description of their behaviors.

******************
 seccomp-profiles
******************

Secure Computing (seccomp) Mode is a feature of the Linux kernel that
allows an administrator to filter system calls being made from a
container. Profiles made up of allowed and restricted calls can be
passed to different containers. *Seccomp* provides more control than
*capabilities* alone, giving a smaller attack surface for an attacker to
work from within a container.

You can set the default action with ``defaultAction`` for a non-listed
system call. Example: ``SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`` filter will allow all the
system calls if it matches the filter rule and you can set it to
``SCMP_ACT_ERRNO`` which will have the thread receive a return value of
*errno* if it calls a system call that matches the filter rule. The file
is formatted in a way that it can take a list of additional system calls
for different architecture and {Project} will automatically take
syscalls related to the current architecture where it's been executed.
The ``include``/``exclude``-> ``caps`` section will include/exclude the
listed system calls if the user has the associated capability.

Use the ``--security`` option to invoke the container like:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} shell --security seccomp:/home/david/my.json my_container.sif

For more insight into security options, network options, cgroups,
capabilities, etc, please check the `Userdocs
<{userdocs}>`_ and it's
`Appendix
<{userdocs}/appendix.html>`_.

*************
 remote.yaml
*************

System-wide remote endpoints are defined in a configuration file
typically located at ``/usr/local/etc/{command}/remote.yaml`` (this
location may vary depending on installation parameters) and can be
managed by administrators with the ``remote`` command group.

Remote Endpoints
================

{Project} allows users to login to an account and authenticate with a
`Library API Registry
<https://singularityhub.github.io/library-api/#/?id=library-api>`_. Whether
that registry exists on premise or in the cloud.

.. note::

   A fresh installation of {Project} is configured with the ``DefaultRemote``,
   which does not support the Library API as it is only configured with a
   functioning key server, ``https://keys.openpgp.org``. Users or administrators
   should configure one of the Library API implementations listed `here
   <https://singularityhub.github.io/library-api/#/?id=library-api>`_ if they would
   like to use a Library API registry.

**Examples**

Use the ``remote`` command group with the ``--global`` flag to create a
system-wide remote endpoint:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} remote add --global company-remote https://enterprise.example.com
   INFO:    Remote "company-remote" added.
   INFO:    Global option detected. Will not automatically log into remote.

Conversely, to remove a system-wide endpoint:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} remote remove --global company-remote
   INFO:    Remote "company-remote" removed.

.. note::

   Once users log in to a system wide endpoint, a copy of the endpoint
   will be listed in a their ``~/.{command}/remote.yaml`` file. This
   means modifications or removal of the system-wide endpoint will not
   be reflected in the users configuration unless they remove the
   endpoint themselves.

Exclusive Endpoint
------------------

{Project} has the ability for an administrator to make a
remote the only usable remote for the system by using the
``--exclusive`` flag:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} remote use --exclusive company-remote
   INFO:    Remote "company-remote" now in use.
   $ {command} remote list
   Cloud Services Endpoints
   ========================

   NAME            URI                     ACTIVE  GLOBAL  EXCLUSIVE  INSECURE
   DefaultRemote   cloud.apptainer.org     NO      YES     NO         NO
   company-remote  enterprise.example.com  YES     YES     YES        NO
   myremote        enterprise.example.com  NO      NO      NO         NO

   Keyservers
   ==========

   URI                       GLOBAL  INSECURE  ORDER
   https://keys.example.com  YES     NO        1*

   * Active cloud services keyserver

Insecure (HTTP) Endpoints
-------------------------

If you are using a endpoint that exposes its
service discovery file over an insecure HTTP connection only, it can be
added by specifying the ``--insecure`` flag:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} remote add --global --insecure test http://test.example.com
   INFO:    Remote "test" added.
   INFO:    Global option detected. Will not automatically log into remote.

This flag controls HTTP vs HTTPS for service discovery only. The
protocol used to access individual library, build and keyserver URLs is
set by the service discovery file.

.. _no_default_remote:

Restoring pre-{Project} library behavior
----------------------------------------

{Project}'s default remote endpoint configures only a public key
server, it does not support the ``library://`` protocol.
Formerly the default was set to point to Sylabs servers, but the 
read/write support of the ``oras://`` protocol by for example the
`GitHub Container Registry
<{userdocs}/docker_and_oci.html#github-container-registry>`_
makes it unnecessary.
The remote endpoint was also formerly used for builds using the
build ``--remote`` option, but {Project} does not support that.
Instead, it supports
`unprivileged local builds <{userdocs}/fakeroot.html#build>`_.

If you would still like to have the previous default for all users,
these are the commands to restore the library behavior from before
{Project}, where using the ``library://`` URI would download from the
Sylabs Cloud anonymously:

.. code::

   $ sudo {command} remote add --global SylabsCloud cloud.sycloud.io
   INFO:    Remote "SylabsCloud" added.
   INFO:    Global option detected. Will not automatically log into remote.
   $ sudo {command} remote use --global SylabsCloud
   INFO:    Remote "SylabsCloud" now in use.
   $ {command} remote list
   Cloud Services Endpoints
   ========================

   NAME           URI                  ACTIVE  GLOBAL  EXCLUSIVE
   DefaultRemote  cloud.apptainer.org  NO      YES     NO
   SylabsCloud    cloud.sycloud.io     YES     YES     NO

   Keyservers
   ==========

   URI                                 GLOBAL  INSECURE  ORDER
   https://keys.production.sycloud.io  YES     NO        1*

   * Active cloud services keyserver

Additional Information
----------------------

For more details on the ``remote`` command group and managing remote
endpoints, please check the `Remote Userdocs
<{userdocs}/endpoint.html>`_.

Keyserver Configuration
=======================

By default, {Project} will use the keyserver correlated to the
active cloud service endpoint. This behavior can be changed or
supplemented via the ``add-keyserver`` and ``remove-keyserver``
commands. These commands allow an administrator to create a global list
of key servers used to verify container signatures by default.

For more details on the ``remote`` command group and managing
keyservers, please check the `Remote Userdocs
<{userdocs}/endpoint.html>`_.


.. _dmtcp_configuration:

*****************
 dmtcp-conf.yaml
*****************

The ``dmtcp-conf.yaml`` is a YAML configuration file that is used to specify the
libraries and executables that need to be injected into the container, without
path information. This configuration is used when running {Project} instances
with application checkpointing ( e.g. ``--dmctp-launch``, ``dmtcp-restart``).

.. note::

    This feature is marked as **experimental** to allow flexibility as community
    feedback may warrant breaking changes to improve the overall usability for
    this feature set as it matures.

Binaries are specified as an array under the ``bins`` key and are found by
searching ``$PATH``:

.. code::

   # List binaries to bind into the container here
   # In shared environments you should ensure that permissions on these files
   # exclude writing by non-privileged users.
   bins:
     - "dmtcp_command"
     - "dmtcp_discover_rm"
     - "dmtcp_launch"
   [...]

Libraries are specified as an array under the ``libs`` key and should be
specified without version information, i.e.
``libname.so``, and are resolved using ``ldconfig``.

.. code::

   # List libraries to bind into the container here. Library names must end in ".so"
   libs:
     - "libdmtcp_alloc.so"
     - "libdmtcp_dl.so"
     - "libdmtcp_modify-env.so"
   [...]

If you receive warnings that binaries or libraries are not found, ensure
that they are in a system path (binaries), or available in paths
configured in ``/etc/ld.so.conf`` (libraries).

For more details on the checkpointing features in {Project}, please check the
`Checkpoint Userdocs <{userdocs}/checkpoint.html>`_.
