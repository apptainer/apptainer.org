<p>Apptainer is a <em>container</em> platform. It allows you to create and run
containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable
and reproducible. You can build a container using Apptainer on your
laptop, and then run it on many of the largest HPC clusters in the
world, local university or company clusters, a single server, in the
cloud, or on a workstation down the hall. Your container is a single
file, and you don’t have to worry about how to install all the software
you need on each different operating system.</p>
<section id="why-use-apptainer">
<h2>Why use Apptainer?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-apptainer" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apptainer was created to run complex applications on HPC clusters in
a simple, portable, and reproducible way. First developed at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, it quickly became popular at other HPC
sites, academic sites, and beyond. Apptainer is an open-source
project, with a friendly community of developers and users. The user
base continues to expand, with Apptainer now used across industry
and academia in many areas of work.</p>
<p>Many container platforms are available, but Apptainer is focused on:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Verifiable reproducibility and security, using cryptographic
signatures, an immutable container image format, and in-memory
decryption.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration over isolation by default. Easily make use of GPUs,
high speed networks, parallel filesystems on a cluster or server
by default.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobility of compute. The single file SIF container format is easy
to transport and share.</p></li>
<li><p>A simple, effective security model. You are the same user inside a
container as outside, and cannot gain additional privilege on the
host system by default. Read more about <a class="reference internal" href="security.html#security"><span class="std std-ref">Security in Apptainer</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="why-use-containers">
<h2>Why use containers?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-containers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A Unix operating system is broken into two primary components, the
kernel space, and the user space. The Kernel talks to the hardware, and
provides core system features. The user space is the environment that
most people are most familiar with. It is where applications, libraries
and system services run.</p>
<p>Traditionally you use an operating system that has a fixed combination
of kernel and user space. If you have access to a machine running CentOS
then you cannot install software that was packaged for Ubuntu on it,
because the user space of these distributions is not compatible. It can
also be very difficult to install multiple versions of the same
software, which might be needed to support reproducibility in different
workflows over time.</p>
<p>Containers change the user space into a swappable component. This means
that the entire user space portion of a Linux operating system,
including programs, custom configurations, and environment can be
independent of whether your system is running CentOS, Fedora etc.,
underneath. An Apptainer container packages up whatever you need into
a single, verifiable file.</p>
<p>Software developers can now build their stack onto whatever operating
system base fits their needs best, and create distributable runtime
environments so that users never have to worry about dependencies and
requirements, that they might not be able to satisfy on their systems.</p>

<section id="byoe-bring-your-own-environment">
<h3>BYOE: Bring Your Own Environment!<a class="headerlink" href="#byoe-bring-your-own-environment" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Engineering work-flows for research computing can be a complicated and
iterative process, and even more so on a shared and somewhat inflexible
production environment. Apptainer solves this problem by making the
environment flexible.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is common (especially in education) for schools to
provide a standardized pre-configured Linux distribution to the students
which includes all of the necessary tools, programs, and configurations
so they can immediately follow along.</p>
</section>
<section id="reproducible-science">
<h3>Reproducible science<a class="headerlink" href="#reproducible-science" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Apptainer containers can be built to include all of the programs,
libraries, data and scripts such that an entire demonstration can be
contained and either archived or distributed for others to replicate no
matter what version of Linux they are presently running.</p>
</section>
<section id="commercially-supported-code-requiring-a-particular-environment">
<h3>Commercially supported code requiring a particular environment<a class="headerlink" href="#commercially-supported-code-requiring-a-particular-environment" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Some commercial applications are only certified to run on particular
versions of Linux. If that application was installed into a
Apptainer container running the version of Linux that it is
certified for, that container could run on any Linux host. The
application environment, libraries, and certified stack would all
continue to run exactly as it is intended.</p>
<p>Additionally, Apptainer blurs the line between container and host
such that your home directory (and other directories) exist within the
container. Applications within the container have full and direct access
to all files you own thus you can easily incorporate the contained
commercial application into your work and process flow on the host.</p>

<section id="static-environments-software-appliances">
<h3>Static environments (software appliances)<a class="headerlink" href="#static-environments-software-appliances" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Fund once, update never software development model. While this is not
ideal, it is a common scenario for research funding. A certain amount of
money is granted for initial development, and once that has been done
the interns, grad students, post-docs, or developers are reassigned to
other projects. This leaves the software stack un-maintained, and even
rebuilds for updated compilers or Linux distributions can not be done
without unfunded effort.</p>
</section>
<section id="legacy-code-on-old-operating-systems">
<h3>Legacy code on old operating systems<a class="headerlink" href="#legacy-code-on-old-operating-systems" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Similar to the above example, while this is less than ideal it is a fact
of the research ecosystem. As an example, I know of one Linux
distribution which has been end of life for 15 years which is still in
production due to the software stack which is custom built for this
environment. Apptainer has no problem running that operating system
and application stack on a current operating system and hardware.</p>
</section>
<section id="complicated-software-stacks-that-are-very-host-specific">
<h3>Complicated software stacks that are very host specific<a class="headerlink" href="#complicated-software-stacks-that-are-very-host-specific" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are various software packages which are so complicated that it
takes much effort in order to port, update and qualify to new operating
systems or compilers. The atmospheric and weather applications are a
good example of this. Porting them to a contained operating system will
prolong the use-fullness of the development effort considerably.</p>
</section>
<section id="complicated-work-flows-that-require-custom-installation-and-or-data">
<h3>Complicated work-flows that require custom installation and/or data<a class="headerlink" href="#complicated-work-flows-that-require-custom-installation-and-or-data" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Consolidating a work-flow into an Apptainer container simplifies
distribution and replication of scientific results. Making containers
available along with published work enables other scientists to build
upon (and verify) previous scientific work.</p>
