apptainer capability
--------------------

Manage Linux capabilities for users and groups

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  Capabilities allow you to have fine grained control over the permissions that
  your containers need to run.

  NOTE: capability add/drop commands require root to run. Granting capabilities 
  to users allows them to escalate privilege inside the container and will
  likely give them a route to privilege escalation on the host system as well.
  Do not add capabilities to users who should not have root on the host system.
