<h2>Security Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#security-policy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you suspect you have found a vulnerability in Apptainer, we want
to work with you so that it can be investigated, fixed, and disclosed in
a responsible manner. Please follow the steps in our published <a class="reference external" href="https://apptainer.org/security-policy/">Security
Policy</a>, which begins with
contacting us privately via <a class="reference external" href="mailto:security&#37;&#52;&#48;apptainer&#46;org">security<span>&#64;</span>apptainer<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>
<p>We disclose vulnerabilities found in Apptainer through public
CVE reports, as well as notifications on our community channels. We
encourage all users to monitor new releases of Apptainer for
security information. Security patches are applied to the latest
release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apptainer grew out of the need to implement a container platform
that was suitable for use on shared systems, such as HPC clusters. In
these environments, multiple people typically need to access the same
shared resource. User accounts, groups, and standard file permissions
limit their access to data and devices, and prevent them from disrupting
or accessing others’ work.</p>
<p>To provide security in these environments a container needs to run as
the user who starts it on the system. Before the widespread adoption of
Linux user namespaces, only a privileged user could perform the
operations which are needed to run a container. A default Docker
installation uses a root-owned daemon to start containers, and users can
request that the daemon start a container on their behalf. However,
coordinating a daemon with other schedulers is difficult and, since the
daemon is privileged, users can ask it to carry out actions that they
wouldn’t normally have permission to carry out themselves.</p>
<p>When a user runs a container with Apptainer, it is started as a
normal process running under the user’s account. Standard file
permissions and other security controls based on user accounts, groups,
and processes apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setuid-user-namespaces">
<h2>Setuid &amp; User Namespaces<a class="headerlink" href="#setuid-user-namespaces" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Using a setuid binary to run container setup operations used to be
essential to support containers on the older Linux distributions that were
previously common in HPC and enterprise.</p>
<p>Most distributions now have
support for unprivileged user namespaces. This means a normal, unprivileged
user can create a user namespace, in which most operations needed
to run a container can be run.</p>
<p>Apptainer still supports running containers with a setuid starter, but
by default it runs containers without setuid, using user namespaces.
If user namespaces are available when compiling, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--without-suid</span></code>
option is implied.
If user namespaces are not available when compiling, the installer
must choose between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--with-suid</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--without-suid</span></code>.
Packages are compiled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--with-suid</span></code> but then the setuid
component is not installed by default and the installer must separately
install the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apptainer-suid</span></code> package if setuid mode is desired.</p>
<p>In non-suid mode <em>all</em> operations run as the user who starts the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apptainer</span></code> program.
This has some advantages over suid mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Setuid-root programs are notoriously difficult to make fully secure.
Apptainer keeps the setuid portions to a minimum and has passed a
careful review, but still it is a risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux kernel developers believe that it is inherently unsafe to
allow unprivileged users to modify an underlying filesystem at will
while kernel code is actively accessing the filesystem
(see this <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/">article</a>).
Kernel filesystem drivers do not and cannot protect against all kinds
of modifications to that data which it has not itself written, and
that fact could potentially be used to attack the kernel.
By the way it does mounts (details below), Apptainer prevents the
most obvious modifications which would enable elevated privileges,
and there are not currently any publicly known kernel attacks for
the filesystem type that Apptainer allows by default (squashfs),
but this is a significant risk.  There is a known public attack
for the ext4 filesystemm that is unpatched on many older operating
systems, so Apptainer disallows using that in setuid-root mode
by default (see this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/security/advisories/GHSA-j4rf-7357-f4cg">advisory</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Non-suid apptainer can run nested inside another apptainer command
or in other container runtimes that restrict setuid-root.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are also some disadvantages of the non-suid mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Mounting from unprivileged user namespaces makes use of FUSE
filesystems, which run extra processes in user space.
This has slightly lower performance than kernel filesystems,
but it has been shown to not be a very significant overhead for
typical HPC workflows.
Metadata operations are still moved to the node running the
container, which is a big advantage over having many files directly
on networked filesystems.</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption is not yet supported. In suid mode, Apptainer uses kernel LUKS2
mounts to run encrypted containers without writing a decrypted
version of their content to disk.
An unprivileged FUSE filesystem will hopefully be able to perform this
operation in a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Some little used <a class="reference internal" href="security_options.html#security-options"><span class="std std-ref">security options</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="networking.html#networking"><span class="std std-ref">network options</span></a> of Apptainer that give users elevated
privileges through configuration are only available in suid mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Apptainer configuration options that restrict the use of containers
are not enforceable, because if unprivileged user namespaces are
available then people could always compile their own copy from source
and set their own configuration options.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the Linux kernel is subject to a much greater amount of
scrutiny than the Apptainer setuid software, there have been a greater
number of announced vulnerabilities that are exploitable through
kernel namespace code than have been announced for Apptainer and
its predecessor.
Security experts generally argue that it is better to have the
scrutiny than to have “security by obscurity”,
but urgently responding to those vulnerabilities causes additional
administrator effort and can cause disruption to operations.
See the <a class="reference external" href="https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/user_namespace.html#disabling-network-namespaces">User Namespaces section</a>
of the admin guide for details about mitigating the impact of user
namespace vulnerabilities through disabling network namespaces.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runtime-user-privilege-model">
<h2>Runtime &amp; User Privilege Model<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-user-privilege-model" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>While other runtimes have aimed to tackle security concerns by
sandboxing containers executing as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> user so that they cannot
affect the host system, Apptainer has adopted a different security
model that protects against attacks even with the setuid-root mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Containers should be run as an unprivileged user.</p></li>
<li><p>The user should never be able to elevate their privileges inside the
container to gain control over the host.</p></li>
<li><p>All permission restrictions on the user outside of a container should
apply inside the container, as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Favor integration over isolation: a user is allowed to easily use
host resources such as GPUs, network filesystems, and high speed
interconnects. The process ID space, network, etc., are not isolated
in separate namespaces by default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, Apptainer uses a number of Linux kernel
features. The container file system is mounted using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nosuid</span></code>
option, and processes are started with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PR_NO_NEW_PRIVS</span></code> flag set.
This means that even if you run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code> inside your container, you
won’t be able to change to another user, or gain root privileges by
other means.</p>
<p>If you do require the additional isolation of the network, devices,
PIDs, etc., which other runtimes provide, Apptainer can make use of
additional namespaces and functionality such as seccomp and cgroups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="singularity-image-format-sif">
<h2>Singularity Image Format (SIF)<a class="headerlink" href="#singularity-image-format-sif" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apptainer uses SIF as its default container format. A SIF container
is a single file, which makes it easy to manage and distribute. Inside
the SIF file, the container filesystem is held in a SquashFS object. When
in suid mode, Apptainer mounts the container filesystem directly using SquashFS,
otherwise it mounts the filesystem with squashfuse. In either case, on a
network filesystem, this means that reads from the container are
data-only. Metadata operations happen locally, speeding up workloads
that involve many small files.</p>
<p>Holding the container image in a single file also enables unique
security features. The container filesystem is immutable, and can be
signed. The signature travels as part of the SIF image itself so that it
is always possible to verify that the image has not been tampered with
or corrupted.</p>
<p>Apptainer uses private PGP keys to create a container signature, and the
corresponding public keys to verify the container. Verification of
signed containers can be done at any time by a user and happens automatically in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apptainer</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> commands against the Library API registries. The prevalence
of PGP key servers, (like <a class="reference external" href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">https://keys.openpgp.org/</a>), make sharing and obtaining
public keys for container verification relatively simple.</p>
<p>A container could be signed once, by a trusted individual who approves
its use. It could also be signed with multiple keys, to signify it has
passed each step in a CI/CD QA &amp; Security process. Apptainer can be
configured with an execution control list (ECL), which requires the
presence of one or more valid signatures, to limit execution to approved
containers.</p>
<p>In addition, the root filesystem of a container (stored in the SquashFS
partition of SIF) can be encrypted. As a result, everything inside the container
becomes inaccessible without the correct key or passphrase. The content of the
container then remains private, even if the SIF file is shared in public.</p>
<p>When in suid mode,
encryption and decryption are performed using the Linux kernel’s LUKS2
feature. This is the same technology routinely used for full disk
encryption. The encrypted container is mounted directly through the
kernel. Unlike other container formats, the encrypted container is run
without ever decrypting its contents to disk.
Encryption and decryption is not currently supported in non-suid mode.</p>

<div class="section" id="configuration-runtime-options">
<h2>Configuration &amp; Runtime Options<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-runtime-options" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>System administrators who manage Apptainer can use configuration
files to set security restrictions, grant or revoke a user’s
capabilities, manage resources, authorize containers, etc.</p>
