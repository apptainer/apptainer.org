We are pleased to announce that Apptainer official PPA for Ubuntu 
is now available.

Users of RHEL-derived operating systems have long benefited
from the availability of Apptainer on the EPEL repository. 

Apptainer pre-built binaries are now also available in an Ubuntu
PPA repository, installable with the apt package manager.
This makes it easy to install and update Apptainer on Ubuntu and
Windows/WSL2/Ubuntu. This PPA supports 22.04 (jammy) and 20.04 (focal)
on both amd64 and arm64 architectures.

See the [Apptainer documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/latest/installation.html#install-ubuntu-packages) for installation instructions.
