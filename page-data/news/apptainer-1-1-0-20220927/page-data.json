It can still be installed that way, but either an extra\napptainer-suid package has to be installed or when compiling an extra\n<code>--without-suid</code> option has to be given to mconfig.</p>\n<p>This is practical because almost all functionality can now be done with\nonly unprivileged user namespaces and readily available unprivileged commands.\nSIF files (that is, squashfs-based files), EXT2/3/4 files, and OverlayFS\ncan all be done with unprivileged, no-setuid FUSE.\nThe only remaining major feature that cannot yet be done fully\nunprivileged is encrypted containers, and we expect to get that into\nversion 1.2.\nThe performance of SIF file mounts through FUSE has been demonstrated to\nbe nearly identical to that of kernel squashfs mounts, thanks to an\nincluded multithreaded version of squashfuse.</p>\n<p>In addition, building of container images can now be done completely\nunprivileged, even if the system administrator did not set up\n/etc/subuid &#x26; /etc/subgid mappings for use with <code>--fakeroot</code>.  This is\ndone by using a root-mapped unprivileged user namespace in combination\nwith the fakeroot command.</p>\n<p>For those who are concerned about kernel vulnerabilities with\nunprivileged user namespaces, please see the\n<a href=\"https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/security.html#setuid-user-namespaces\">security discussion</a>\nin the user guide especially including the link to the admin guide where\nit advises disabling network namespaces.</p>\n<p>This version is also planned to be installed in EPEL and Fedora within\nabout a week.  Upgrading the singularity package will install a\nnon-setuid root apptainer package by default.</p>\n<p>If this is the first time you are upgrading from Singularity please see\n<a href=\"https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/singularity_migration.html\">Migrating from Singularity</a>\nin the admin guide.</p>\n<p>As always, please report any problems as an\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/issues\">issue on github</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 27, 2022","slug":"/news/apptainer-1-1-0-20220927","title":"Announcing Apptainer release 1.1.0, rootless by default"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e3934110-08ea-5974-a99d-a857da484a2b","frontmatter__slug":"/news/apptainer-1-1-0-20220927","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"news"}}},
