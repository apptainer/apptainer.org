singularity remote status
-------------------------

Check the status of the singularity services at an endpoint, and your authentication token

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  The 'remote status' command checks the status of the specified remote endpoint
  and reports the availability of services and their versions. If no endpoint is
  specified, it will check the status of the default remote (SylabsCloud). If you
  have logged in with an authentication token the validity of that token will be
  checked.
