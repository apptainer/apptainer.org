singularity inspect
-------------------

Show metadata for an image

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  Inspect will show you labels, environment variables, apps and scripts associated 
  with the image determined by the flags you pass. By default, they will be shown in 
  plain text. If you would like to list them in json format, you should use the --json flag.
  

::

  singularity inspect [inspect options...] <image path>

Examples
~~~~~~~~

::


    $ singularity inspect ubuntu.sif
    
    If you want to list the applications (apps) installed in a container (located at
    /scif/apps) you should run inspect command with --list-apps <container-image> flag.
    ( See https://sci-f.github.io for more information on SCIF apps)

    The following environment variables are available to you when called 
    from the shell inside the container. The top variables are relevant 
    to the active app (--app <app>) and the bottom available for all 
    apps regardless of the active app. Both sets of variables are also available during development (at build time).

    ACTIVE APP ENVIRONMENT:
        SCIF_APPNAME       the name for the active application
        SCIF_APPROOT       the installation folder for the application created at /scif/apps/<app>
        SCIF_APPMETA       the application metadata folder
        SCIF_APPDATA       the data folder created for the application at /scif/data/<app>
          SCIF_APPINPUT    expected input folder within data base folder
          SCIF_APPOUTPUT   the output data folder within data base folder

        SCIF_APPENV        points to the application's custom environment.sh file in its metadata folder
        SCIF_APPLABELS     is the application's labels.json in the metadata folder
        SCIF_APPBIN        is the bin folder for the app, which is automatically added to the $PATH when the app is active
        SCIF_APPLIB        is the application's library folder that is added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        SCIF_APPRUN        is the runscript
        SCIF_APPHELP       is the help file for the runscript
        SCIF_APPTEST       is the testing script (test.sh) associated with the applicatio
        SCIF_APPNAME       the name for the active application
        SCIF_APPFILES      the files section associated with the application that are added to


    GLOBAL APP ENVIRONMENT:
      
        SCIF_DATA             scif defined data base for all apps (/scif/data)
        SCIF_APPS             scif defined install bases for all apps (/scif/apps)
        SCIF_APPROOT_<app>    root for application <app>
        SCIF_APPDATA_<app>    data root for application <app>

    To list all your apps:

    $ singularity inspect --list-apps ubuntu.sif 

    To list only labels in the json format from an image:

    $ singularity inspect --json --labels ubuntu.sif

    To verify you own a single application on your container image, use the --app <appname> flag:

    $ singularity inspect --app <appname> ubuntu.sif

Options

  -l, --labels        show the labels for the image (default)
      --list-apps     list all apps in a container
  -r, --runscript     show the runscript for the image
