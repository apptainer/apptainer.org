singularity push
----------------

Upload image to the provided URI

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  The 'push' command allows you to upload a SIF container to a given
  URI.  Supported URIs include:

  library:
      library://user/collection/container[:tag]

  oras:
      oras://registry/namespace/repo:tag


  NOTE: It's always good practice to sign your containers before
  pushing them to the library. An auth token is required to push to the library,
  so you may need to configure it first with 'singularity remote'.

::

  singularity push [push options...] <image> <URI>

Examples
~~~~~~~~

::


    To Library
    $ singularity push /home/user/my.sif library://user/collection/my.sif:latest

    To supported OCI registry
    $ singularity push /home/user/my.sif oras://registry/namespace/image:tag

Options
~~~~~~~

::

  -U, --allow-unsigned       do not require a signed container image
  -D, --description string   description for container image (library:// only)
  -h, --help                 help for push
      --library string       the library to push to
