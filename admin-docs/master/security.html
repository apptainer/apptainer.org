<section id="background">
<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Singularity grew out of the need to implement a container platform
that was suitable for use on shared systems, such as HPC clusters. In
these environments multiple people access a shared resource. User
accounts, groups, and standard file permissions limit their access to
data, devices, and prevent them from disrupting or accessing others’
work.</p>
<p>To provide security in these environments a container needs to run as
the user who starts it on the system. Before the widespread adoption of
the Linux user namespace, only a privileged user could perform the
operations which are needed to run a container. A default Docker
installation uses a root-owned daemon to start containers. Users can
request that the daemon starts a container on their behalf. However,
coordinating a daemon with other schedulers is difficult and, since the
daemon is privileged, users can ask it to carry out actions that they
wouldn’t normally have permission to do.</p>
<p>When a user runs a container with Singularity, it is started as a
normal process running under the user’s account. Standard file
permissions and other security controls based on user accounts, groups,
and processes apply. In a default installation Singularity uses a
setuid starter binary to perform only the specific tasks needed to setup
the container.</p>
</section>
<section id="setuid-user-namespaces">
<h2>Setuid &amp; User Namespaces<a class="headerlink" href="#setuid-user-namespaces" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Using a setuid binary to run container setup operations is essential to
support containers on older Linux distributions, such as CentOS 6, that
were previously common in HPC and enterprise. Newer distributions have
support for ‘unprivileged user namespace creation’. This means a normal
user can create a user namespace, in which most setup operations needed
to run a container can be run, unprivileged.</p>
<p>Singularity supports running containers without setuid, using user
namespaces. It can be compiled with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--without-suid</span></code> option, or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allow</span> <span class="pre">setuid</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">no</span></code> can be set in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">singularity.conf</span></code> to enable this.
In this mode <em>all</em> operations run as the user who starts the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">singularity</span></code> program. However, there are some disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SIF and other single file container images cannot be mounted
directly. The container image must be extracted to a directory on
disk to run. This may impact the speed of execution. Workloads accessing
large numbers of small files (such as python application startup) do
not benefit from the reduced metadata load on the filesystem an image
file provides. (This behavior could be done by an unprivileged FUSE
mount but that is not yet implemented).</p></li>
<li><p>Persistent overlays using the exec/run/shell <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--overlay</span></code> option does not
work because that uses the privileged kernel OverlayFS filesystem.
(This behavior could be done with unprivileged OverlayFS in recent
kernels but that is not yet implemented).</p></li>
<li><p>The effectiveness of signing and verifying container images is
reduced as, when extracted to a directory, modification is possible
and verification of the image’s original signature cannot be
performed.</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption is not supported. Singularity leverages kernel LUKS2
mounts to run encrypted containers without decrypting their content
to disk.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the points above, the default mode of operation of
Singularity uses a setuid binary. The Singularity community aims to reduce the
circumstances that require this as new functionality is developed and
reaches commonly deployed Linux distributions.</p>
</section>
<section id="runtime-user-privilege-model">
<h2>Runtime &amp; User Privilege Model<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-user-privilege-model" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>While other runtimes have aimed to safely sandbox containers executing
as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> user, so that they cannot affect the host system,
Singularity has adopted an alternative security model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Containers should be run as an unprivileged user.</p></li>
<li><p>The user should never be able to elevate their privileges inside the
container to gain control over the host.</p></li>
<li><p>All permission restrictions on the user outside of a container should
apply inside the container.</p></li>
<li><p>Favor integration over isolation. Allow a user to use host resources
such as GPUs, network file systems, high speed interconnects easily.
The process ID space, network etc. are not isolated in separate
namespaces by default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, Singularity uses a number of Linux kernel
features. The container file system is mounted using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nosuid</span></code>
option, and processes are started with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</span></code> flag.
This means that there is no possible way to change the user or group id,
gain root privileges or gain any additional capabilities when executing
another program.</p>
<p>If you do require the additional isolation of the network, devices, PIDs
etc. provided by other runtimes, Singularity can make use of
additional namespaces and functionality such as seccomp and cgroups.</p>
</section>
<section id="singularity-image-format-sif">
<h2>Singularity Image Format (SIF)<a class="headerlink" href="#singularity-image-format-sif" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Singularity uses SIF as its default container format. A SIF container
is a single file, which makes it easy to manage and distribute. Inside
the SIF file, the container filesystem is held in a SquashFS object. By
default, we mount the container filesystem directly using SquashFS. On a
network filesystem this means that reads from the container are
data-only. Metadata operations happen locally, speeding up workloads
with many small files.</p>
<p>Holding the container image in a single file also enables unique security
features. The container filesystem is immutable, and can be signed. The
signature travels in the SIF image itself so that it is always possible
to verify that the image has not been tampered with or corrupted.</p>
<p>We use private PGP keys to create a container signature, and the public
key in order to verify the container. Verification of signed containers
happens automatically in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">singularity</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> commands when using a
<cite>library://</cite> URI.</p>
<p>A container may be signed once, by a trusted individual who approves its
use. It could also be signed with multiple keys to signify it has passed
each step in a CI/CD QA &amp; Security process. Singularity can be
configured with an execution control list (ECL), which requires the
presence of one or more valid signatures, to limit execution to approved
containers.</p>
<p>In Singularity 3.4 and above, the root filesystem of a container
(stored in the squashFS partition of SIF) can be encrypted. As a result,
everything inside the container becomes inaccessible without the correct
key or passphrase. The content of the container is private, even if the
SIF file is shared in public.</p>
<p>Encryption and decryption are performed using the Linux kernel’s LUKS2
feature. This is the same technology routinely used for full disk
encryption. The encrypted container is mounted directly through the
kernel. Unlike other container formats, an encrypted container is not
decrypted to disk in order to run it.</p>

<section id="configuration-runtime-options">
<h2>Configuration &amp; Runtime Options<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-runtime-options" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>System administrators who manage Singularity can use configuration
files to set security restrictions, grant or revoke a user’s
capabilities, manage resources and authorize containers etc.</p>
<p>For example, the <a class="reference internal" href="configfiles.html#execution-control-list"><span class="std std-ref">Execution Control List</span></a> file
allows restricting usage of SIF containers based on their signature
and the key used to sign them.</p>
<p>Configuration files and their parameters are <a class="reference internal" href="configfiles.html#singularity-configfiles"><span class="std std-ref">documented for
administrators here</span></a>.</p>
<p>When running a container as root, Singularity can apply hardening rules using
cgroups, seccomp, apparmor. See the ‘security options’ section of the user
guide, and <a class="reference internal" href="configfiles.html#cgroups-toml"><span class="std std-ref">cgroups.toml documentation</span></a>.</p>
