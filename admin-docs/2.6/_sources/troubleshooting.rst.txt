This section will help you debug (from the system administrator’s
perspective) Singularity.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Not installed correctly, or installed to a non-compatible location
------------------------------------------------------------------

Singularity must be installed by root into a location that allows for
``SUID`` programs to be executed (as described above in the installation
section of this manual). If you fail to do that, you may have user’s
reporting one of the following error conditions:

.. code-block:: none

    ERROR  : Singularity must be executed in privileged mode to use images

    ABORT  : Retval = 255

.. code-block:: none

    ERROR  : User namespace not supported, and program not running privileged.

    ABORT  : Retval = 255

.. code-block:: none

    ABORT  : This program must be SUID root

    ABORT  : Retval = 255

If one of these errors is reported, it is best to check the installation
of Singularity and ensure that it was properly installed by the root
user onto a local file system.
