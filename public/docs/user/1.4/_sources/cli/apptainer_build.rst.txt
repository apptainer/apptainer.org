---------------

Build an Apptainer image

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~




  IMAGE PATH:

  When Apptainer builds the container, output can be one of a few formats:

      default:    The compressed Apptainer read only image format (default)
      sandbox:    This is a read-write container within a directory structure

  note: It is a common workflow to use the "sandbox" mode for development of the
  container, and then build it as a default Apptainer image for production
  use. The default format is immutable.

  BUILD SPEC:

  The build spec target is a definition (def) file, local image, or URI that can 
  be used to create an Apptainer container. Several different local target
  formats exist:

      def file  : This is a recipe for building a container (examples below)
      directory:  A directory structure containing a (ch)root file system
      image:      A local image on your machine (will convert to sif if
                  it is legacy format)

  Targets can also be remote and defined by a URI of the following formats:

      library://  an image library (no default)
      docker://   a Docker/OCI registry (default Docker Hub)
      shub://     an Apptainer registry (default Singularity Hub)
      oras://     an OCI registry that holds SIF files using ORAS

  Temporary files:
  
  The location used for temporary directories defaults to '/tmp' but
  can be overridden by the TMPDIR environment variable, and that can be
  overridden by the APPTAINER_TMPDIR environment variable.  The
  temporary directory used during a build must be on a filesystem that
  has enough space to hold the entire container image, uncompressed,
  including any temporary files that are created and later removed
  during the build. You may need to set APPTAINER_TMPDIR or TMPDIR when
  building a large container on a system that has a small /tmp filesystem.

    The following sections are presented in the order of processing, with the exception
    that labels and environment can also be manipulated in %post.

        %pre
            echo "This is a scriptlet that will be executed on the host, as root before"
            echo "the container has been bootstrapped. This section is not commonly used."

        %setup
            echo "This is a scriptlet that will be executed on the host, as root, after"
            echo "the container has been bootstrapped. To install things into the container"
            echo "reference the file system location with $APPTAINER_ROOTFS."

        %files
            /path/on/host/file.txt /path/on/container/file.txt
            relative_file.txt /path/on/container/relative_file.txt

        %post
            echo "This scriptlet section will be executed from within the container after"
            echo "the bootstrap/base has been created and setup."

            echo "built. This scriptlet will be executed from within the running container"
            echo "as the root user. Pay attention to the exit/return value of this scriptlet"
            echo "as any non-zero exit code will be assumed as failure."
