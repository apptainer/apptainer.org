singularity key pull
--------------------

Download a public key from a key server

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  The 'key pull' command allows you to retrieve public key material from a
  remote key server, and add it to your keyring. Note that Singularity consults
  your keyring when running commands such as 'singularity verify', and thus
  adding a key to your keyring implies a level of trust. Because of this, it is
  recommended that you verify the fingerprint of the key with its owner prior
  to running this command.
