singularity shell
-----------------

Run a shell within a container

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  singularity shell supports the following formats:

  *.sif               Singularity Image Format (SIF). Native to Singularity 3.0+
  
  *.sqsh              SquashFS format.  Native to Singularity 2.4+

  *.img               ext3 format. Native to Singularity versions < 2.4.

  directory/          sandbox format. Directory containing a valid root file 
                      system and optionally Singularity meta-data.

  instance://*        A local running instance of a container. (See the instance
                      command group.)

  library://*         A SIF container hosted on a Library
                      (default https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)

  docker://*          A Docker/OCI container hosted on Docker Hub or another
                      OCI registry.

  shub://*            A container hosted on Singularity Hub.

  oras://*            A SIF container hosted on an OCI registry that supports
                      the OCI Registry As Storage (ORAS) specification.

Options
~~~~~~~

::

      --add-caps string        a comma separated capability list to add
      --allow-setuid           allow setuid binaries in container (root only)
      --app string             set an application to run inside a container
      --apply-cgroups string   apply cgroups from file for container processes (root only)
  -B, --bind strings           a user-bind path specification.  spec has the format src[:dest[:opts]], where src and dest are outside and inside paths.  If dest is not given, it is set equal to src.  Mount options ('opts') may be specified as 'ro' (read-only) or 'rw' (read/write, which is the default). Multiple bind paths can be given by a comma separated list.
  -e, --cleanenv               clean environment before running container
  -c, --contain                use minimal /dev and empty other directories (e.g. /tmp and $HOME) instead of sharing filesystems from your host
  -C, --containall             contain not only file systems, but also PID, IPC, and environment
      --disable-cache          dont use cache, and dont create cache
      --dns string             list of DNS server separated by commas to add in resolv.conf
      --docker-login           login to a Docker Repository interactively
      --drop-caps string       a comma separated capability list to drop
      --env strings            pass environment variable to contained process
      --env-file string        pass environment variables from file to contained process
  -f, --fakeroot               run container in new user namespace as uid 0
      --fusemount strings      A FUSE filesystem mount specification of the form '<type>:<fuse command> <mountpoint>' - where <type> is 'container' or 'host', specifying where the mount will be performed ('container-daemon' or 'host-daemon' will run the FUSE process detached). <fuse command> is the path to the FUSE executable, plus options for the mount. <mountpoint> is the location in the container to which the FUSE mount will be attached. E.g. 'container:sshfs 10.0.0.1:/ /sshfs'. Implies --pid.
  -h, --help                   help for shell
  -H, --home string            a home directory specification.  spec can either be a src path or src:dest pair.  src is the source path of the home directory outside the container and dest overrides the home directory within the container. (default "/home/runner")
      --hostname string        set container hostname
  -i, --ipc                    run container in a new IPC namespace
      --keep-privs             let root user keep privileges in container (root only)
  -n, --net                    run container in a new network namespace (sets up a bridge network interface by default)
      --network string         specify desired network type separated by commas, each network will bring up a dedicated interface inside container (default "bridge")
      --network-args strings   specify network arguments to pass to CNI plugins
      --no-home                do NOT mount users home directory if /home is not the current working directory
      --no-init                do NOT start shim process with --pid
      --no-mount strings       disable one or more mount xxx options set in singularity.conf
      --no-privs               drop all privileges from root user in container)
      --no-umask               do not propagate umask to the container, set default 0022 umask
      --nohttps                do NOT use HTTPS with the docker:// transport (useful for local docker registries without a certificate)
      --nonet                  disable VM network handling
      --nv                     enable experimental Nvidia support
  -o, --overlay strings        use an overlayFS image for persistent data storage or as read-only layer of container
      --passphrase             prompt for an encryption passphrase

      --pwd string             initial working directory for payload process inside the container
      --rocm                   enable experimental Rocm support
  -S, --scratch strings        include a scratch directory within the container that is linked to a temporary dir (use -W to force location)
      --security strings       enable security features (SELinux, Apparmor, Seccomp)
  -s, --shell string           path to program to use for interactive shell
      --syos                   execute SyOS shell
  -u, --userns                 run container in a new user namespace, allowing Singularity to run completely unprivileged on recent kernels. This disables some features of Singularity, for example it only works with sandbox images.
      --uts                    run container in a new UTS namespace
      --vm                     enable VM support
      --vm-cpu string          number of CPU cores to allocate to Virtual Machine (implies --vm) (default "1")

  -W, --workdir string         working directory to be used for /tmp, /var/tmp and $HOME (if -c/--contain was also used)
  -w, --writable               by default all Singularity containers are available as read only. This option makes the file system accessible as read/write.
      --writable-tmpfs         makes the file system accessible as read-write with non persistent data (with overlay support only)
