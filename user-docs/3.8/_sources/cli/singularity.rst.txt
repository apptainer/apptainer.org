singularity
-----------


Linux container platform optimized for High Performance Computing (HPC) and
Enterprise Performance Computing (EPC)

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  Singularity containers provide an application virtualization layer enabling
  mobility of compute via both application and environment portability. With
  Singularity one is capable of building a root file system that runs on any 
  other Linux system where Singularity is installed.

  singularity [global options...]

Examples
~~~~~~~~

::


    $ singularity help <command> [<subcommand>]
    $ singularity help build
    $ singularity help instance start

Options
~~~~~~~

::

  -c, --config string   specify a configuration file (for root or unprivileged installation only) (default "/usr/local/etc/singularity/singularity.conf")
  -d, --debug           print debugging information (highest verbosity)
  -h, --help            help for singularity
      --nocolor         print without color output (default False)
  -q, --quiet           suppress normal output
  -s, --silent          only print errors
  -v, --verbose         print additional information
