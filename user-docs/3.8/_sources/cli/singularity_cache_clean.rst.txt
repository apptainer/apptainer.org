singularity cache clean
-----------------------

Clean your local Singularity cache

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~



  This will clean your local cache (stored at $HOME/.singularity/cache if
  SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR is not set). By default the entire cache is cleaned, use
  --days and --type flags to override this behavior. Note: if you use Singularity
  as root, cache will be stored in '/root/.singularity/.cache', to clean that
  cache, you will need to run 'cache clean' as root, or with 'sudo'.
