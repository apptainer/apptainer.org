Overview
--------

You may wish to customize your build
environment by doing things such as specifying a custom cache directory for images or
sending your Docker Credentials to the registry endpoint. Here we will discuss these and other topics
related to the build environment.

-------------
Cache Folders
-------------

To make downloading images for build and :ref:`pull <pull-command>` faster and less redundant, Singularity
uses a caching strategy. By default, Singularity will create
a set of folders in your ``$HOME`` directory for docker layers, Cloud library images, and metadata, respectively:

.. code-block:: none

    $HOME/.singularity/cache/library
    $HOME/.singularity/cache/oci
    $HOME/.singularity/cache/oci-tmp

If you want to cache in a different directory, set ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` to the desired path.
By using the ``-E`` option with the ``sudo`` command, ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` will be passed along
to root's environment and respected during the build.
Remember that when you run commands as root images will be cached in root’s home at ``/root`` and not your user’s home.

--------------
Cache commands
--------------

Singularity 3.1 comes with new commands for cleaning and listing the cache image files generated.

Listing Cache
=============

For example, you can list cache image files and check which type they belong to: Library or oci.

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity cache list
    NAME                   DATE CREATED           SIZE             TYPE
    ubuntu_latest.sif      2019-01-31 14:59:32    28.11 Mb         library
    ubuntu_18.04.sif       2019-01-31 14:58:44    27.98 Mb         library
    alpine_latest.sif      2019-01-31 14:58:24    2.18 Mb          library
    centos_latest.sif      2019-01-31 14:59:07    72.96 Mb         library
    centos_latest.sif      2019-01-31 14:59:26    73.45 Mb         oci
    ubuntu_18.04.sif       2019-01-31 14:58:58    27.99 Mb         oci
    ubuntu_latest.sif      2019-01-31 14:59:41    27.99 Mb         oci
    alpine_latest.sif      2019-01-31 14:58:30    2.72 Mb          oci

    There are 15 oci blob file(s) using 112.51 Mb of space. Use: '-T=blob' to list

You can also clean a specific cache type, choosing between: ``library``, ``oci``, ``blob`` (separated by commas)

.. code-block:: none

    # clean only library cache
    $ singularity cache clean --type=library

    # clean only oci cache
    $ singularity cache clean --type=oci

    # clean only blob cache
    $ singularity cache clean --type=blob

    # clean only library, and oci cache
    $ singularity cache clean --type=library,oci

.. note::

    This feature of passing additional flags with comma-separated arguments can also be used with the ``singularity cache clean`` command we will see below.

Cleaning the Cache
==================

Most of the ``cache clean`` and ``cache list`` flags can be interchanged, (``--name`` is only reserved for ``cache clean``).

It's worth noting that by running the following command: (with no flags)

..code-block:: none

    $ singularity cache clean

By default will just clean the blob cache, but if you do:

..code-block:: none

    $ singularity cache clean --all

It will clean all the cache.

-----------------
Temporary Folders
-----------------

 .. _sec:temporaryfolders:

 Singularity uses a temporary directory to build the squashfs filesystem,
 and this temp space needs to be large enough to hold the entire resulting Singularity image.
 By default this happens in ``/tmp`` but the location can be configured by setting ``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR`` to the full
 path where you want the sandbox and squashfs temp files to be stored. Remember to use ``-E`` option to pass the value of ``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR``
 to root's environment when executing the ``build`` command with ``sudo``.

 When you run one of the action commands (i.e. ``run``, ``exec``, or ``shell``) with a container from the
 container library or an OCI registry, Singularity builds the container in the temporary directory caches it
 and runs it from the cached location.

 Consider the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity exec docker://busybox /bin/sh

This container is first built in ``/tmp``. Since all the oci blobs are converted into SIF format,
by default a temporary runtime directory is created in:

.. code-block:: none

    $HOME/.singularity/cache/oci-tmp/<sha256-code>/busybox_latest.sif

In this case, the ``SINGULARITY_TMPDIR`` and ``SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`` variables will also be respected.

-----------
Pull Folder
-----------

For details about customizing the output location of :ref:`pull <pull-command>`, see the
:ref:`pull docs <pull-command>`. You have the similar ability to set it to be something
different, or to customize the name of the pulled image.

---------------------
Environment Variables
---------------------

#. If a flag is represented by both a CLI option and an environment variable, and both are set, the CLI option will always take precedence. This is true for all environment variables except for ``SINGULARITY_BIND`` and ``SINGULARITY_BINDPATH`` which is combined with the ``--bind`` option, argument pair if both are present.

#. Environment variables overwrite default values in the CLI code

#. Any defaults in the CLI code are applied.


Defaults
========

The following variables have defaults that can be customized by you via
environment variables at runtime.

Docker
------

**SINGULARITY_DOCKER_LOGIN** Used for the interactive login for Docker Hub.

**SINGULARITY_DOCKER_USERNAME** Your Docker username.

**SINGULARITY_DOCKER_PASSWORD** Your Docker password.

**RUNSCRIPT_COMMAND** Is not obtained from the environment, but is a
hard coded default (“/bin/bash”). This is the fallback command used in
the case that the docker image does not have a CMD or ENTRYPOINT.
**TAG** Is the default tag, ``latest``.

**SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS** This is relevant if you want to use a
registry that doesn’t have https, and it speaks for itself. If you
export the variable ``SINGULARITY_NOHTTPS`` you can force the software to not use https when
interacting with a Docker registry. This use case is typically for use
of a local registry.

Library
-------

**SINGULARITY_BUILDER** Used to specify the remote builder service URL. The default value is our remote builder.

**SINGULARITY_LIBRARY** Used to specify the library to pull from. Default is set to our Cloud Library.

**SINGULARITY_REMOTE** Used to build an image remotely (This does not require root). The default is set to false.
